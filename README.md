# Singapore NDVI Project

This project investigates the use of cloud masks to remove clouds while calculating NDVI over time.

Note: landsatxplore has some compatibility issues with click - specifically, it needs click<8.0, but other geospatial programs require click 8.1.7. Best solution would be to run landsatxplore in a different environment.
